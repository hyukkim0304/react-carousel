### Before

My plan is to make each compoenents as modular as possible.
I can already think that image viewer and modal can be used globally in many different components
Expecting heavy work on CSS to make it look nice and work smoothly (slide animation, swipe handler on mobile, and more)
With desktop version mockup only, I will try my best to make it look/work nice on mobile and tablet

### After

Carousel functionality part was not so bad but as I expected, CSS part was difficult.
I was able to make components somewhat modular. Used image viewer component on both carousel and modal.
I would have made buttons and carousel indicators modular as well since they share simillar functionalities if I have more time.
Spent quite a bit of time on fixing css module with global mixin problem (fix was using craco-sass-resources-loader)
External pacakages used : react-swipeable, material-ui/icons
